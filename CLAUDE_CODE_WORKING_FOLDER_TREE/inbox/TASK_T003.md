# TASK_T003 - Windows rehearsal of the E2R-CODE-1 install, in a task clone

**Task ID:** T003. **Date:** 29 October 2026. **Author:** the Claude web chat. The same steps as T002, for the FINAL package (register v0.11 owner-ratified) and with E2R-T12, which the project owner approved on 29 October 2026.

**Purpose.** Run the final E2R-CODE-1 install package v2 (`exchange/EX_037_Claude/E2R_CODE1_Install_v2.zip`) on the owner's Windows machine, but in a disposable task clone that cannot push, so the main repository is not changed at all. This shows how the package's checks and tests behave on a real Windows checkout before the owner's own install. It is a rehearsal only: it installs nothing, authorises nothing, and is not the owner's install or the reviewer's RECHECK.

It differs from the owner's real install in three ways: it runs in a task clone, not the main repository; files are copied by `tools\cc_clone.py overlay`, not `xcopy`; and there is no `git pull` and no push. All 138 tests run, including E2R-T12.

## Owner options

- None. E2R-T12 (one test that starts up to six ordinary Python worker processes, which finish normally) is run in step 9; the project owner approved it on 29 October 2026.

## Paths

| Name | Full path |
|---|---|
| MAIN (the main repository) | `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality` |
| PY (the main venv's Python) | `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` |
| TOOLS | `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools` |
| CLONE (the task clone) | `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r` |
| PKG (the extracted package) | `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2` |

The commands below are written out in full. Run each from MAIN (your normal workspace folder). On anything other than the expected PASS line, or a non-zero exit code: **STOP**, record the output, and go to step 15 (clean-up).

## Steps

**1. Python.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I -c "import sys, platform; print(sys.executable); print(sys.version); print(platform.platform())"
```
Expected: the venv path, a Python version, and a Windows platform line.

**2. The main repository's state** (read-only; record the output; this step does not stop the task).
```
git status --short
git rev-parse HEAD
git log -1 --format=%s
```

**3. Make the task clone.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" make --task T003
```
Expected: `GUARD PASS`, `git remote -v: ''`, the two HEAD lines, the `core.autocrlf` line, then `MAKE PASS`.

**4. Check and extract the package** (from the clone's own copy of EX_037).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" unzip --task T003 --zip exchange/EX_037_Claude/E2R_CODE1_Install_v2.zip --sha256 5a2b978c96d82e3159cc50e8c24a2f29a944a39d29b7452452f8b484b9a23a11
```
Expected: `ZIP SHA-256: 5a2b978c...3a11`, then `UNZIP PASS: ... files extracted`.

**5. PRE check.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" guard --task T003
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2\VERIFY_E2R_CODE1_INSTALL.py" --repo "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r" --phase pre
```
Expected: `GUARD PASS`, then `PRE PASS`.

**6. Copy the overlay into the clone** (new files only).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" overlay --task T003 --src "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2\repo_overlay"
```
Expected: `OVERLAY PASS: 156 files copied`.

**7. POST check.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2\VERIFY_E2R_CODE1_INSTALL.py" --repo "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r" --phase post
```
Expected: `POST PASS`.

**8. Module origin** (the tests must use the clone's code, not the main repository's).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\check_module_origin.py" --repo "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r"
```
Expected: every module line starts `ok`, the contract-data and registry lines, then `ORIGIN PASS`.

**9. All 138 tests, including E2R-T12** (the package's own runner).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2\RUN_E2R_SUITE.py" --repo "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r"
```
Expected: `SUITE PASS: all 138 tests ran and passed`.

**10. Stage in the clone.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" git --task T003 -- add doc review src tests
```
Expected: `GUARD PASS (before)`, then `GUARD PASS (after); git add exit code 0`.

**11. Status in the clone.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" git --task T003 -- status --short
```
Expected: 156 lines, every one starting with `A`, and `git status exit code 0`. In the report, give the count of lines, the count starting with `A`, and every line that does not start with `A` (do not paste all 156 lines).

**12. Commit in the clone** (this commit exists only in the task clone and is deleted with it).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" git --task T003 -- commit -q -m "E2R-CODE-1 rehearsal (task clone T003 only; never pushed)"
```
Expected: `git commit exit code 0`.

**13. COMMITTED check.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\p\E2R_CODE1_Install_v2\VERIFY_E2R_CODE1_INSTALL.py" --repo "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\scratch\T003\r" --phase committed
```
Expected: `COMMITTED PASS`. (In a task clone, if this STOPs, the identity report's "upstream" lines will say there is no upstream; that is expected and is not the cause.)

**14. Final state of the clone.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" git --task T003 -- log --oneline -2
```
Expected: the rehearsal commit on top of the clone's starting commit, and `git log exit code 0`.

## Clean-up (always, whether the task passed or stopped)

**15. Remove the task clone.**
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" remove --task T003
```
Expected: `REMOVE PASS`. If it STOPs, leave the folder as it is, say so in the report, and do not run step 17; tell the project owner.

## Report

**16. Write** `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\outbox\REPORT_T003.md` in the format of `outbox\README.md`, with every step's command, exit code and full output (step 11 as described there). Also record:
- the wall-clock time step 9 took;
- whether the main repository's `git status --short` after step 15 is the same as in step 2 (run it again and include it).

## Finish

**17. Commit the report** (one file; not pushed).
```
"E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -I "E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\powerball\analysing_perceived_randomness_in_reality\CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_FOLDER_TREE\tools\cc_clone.py" commit-report --task T003
```
Expected: `COMMIT-REPORT PASS`. If it STOPs, leave the report uncommitted and tell the project owner.

**18. Tell the project owner** the RESULT line, the report's path, and: "please push".
